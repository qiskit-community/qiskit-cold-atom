    Fix incorrect parsing of spin operators in SpinCircuitSolver._embed_operator: 
    The previous implementation of this method was not able to handle gates where the generator 
    included terms that had a different number of non-identity operators.
    The new implementation of this method is able to handle the more general case as well.
