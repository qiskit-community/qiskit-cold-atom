upgrade:
  - |
    The API for a Cold Atom Job now takes a token instead of a password. Furthermore,
    get requests are no-longer done with an entry under json in the request params
    but are instead done using a job_id entry. Post requests are now done with
    the structure json={"job": ..., ...} instead of data={"json": ..., ...}.
